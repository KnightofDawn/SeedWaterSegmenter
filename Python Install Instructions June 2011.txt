Instructions to run SeedWater Segmenter:

1: Install (and then test) python and necessary modules
------------------------------------
Windows:
    Download Enthought Python Distribution:
        http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php
            (No need to enter personal info...)
    Install EPD
        If on XP, choose install for all users
        If on Windows 7 or Vista, choose install for just me
    Test:
        Open a DOS window (can invoke it by running the command "cmd")
        Type and run "C:\Python26\python.exe"
        Type and run "import numpy"
            (It works if it pops up with the ">>>" below and does not genetate a large error message)
Ubuntu (or Debian):
    Install the necessary packages with this command:
        sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-matplotlib python-wxtools cython python-imaging python-xlrd python-xlwt
    Test:
        In a terminal, run "python"
        Type and run "import numpy"
            (It works if it pops up with the ">>>" below and does not genetate a large error message)
Mac OS X:
    Download Enthought Python Distribution:
        http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php
            (No need to enter personal info...)
    Install EPD
    Test:
        In Terminal, run "python"
        Type and run "import numpy"
            (It works if it pops up with the ">>>" below and does not genetate a large error message)
Other:
    Ask me...

1B: Install Mahotas
---------------------------------------
The watershed algorithm that used to come from a modified version of PyMorph by Luis Pedro
now comes from the package "mahotas" by Luis Pedro (new implementation of the same algorithm).
It is much faster!

All platforms:
    Open a shell (cmd on Windows, Terminal on Mac and Linux)
    Type and run the command:
        easy_install mahotas
    Give it permission if needed


2: Install SeedWater:
---------------------------------------
Choose a location (empty directory) to store the SeedWater script files
   (I like a place where I can edit them without special permissions, usually in my Home folder)
Copy all the SeedWater files into this folder (in the zip file)
Copy the full path to this folder
    Open seedwater.pth and paste this path WITHOUT QUOTES (will probably start with C:\)
        Change all the \ characters to / characters
        Copy the new version of the path.
    Open "SetEnvironVars.py" and change the value of d to be the path you just copied (in quotes, no \ characters).

Copy the "seedwater.pth" file to:
(On Windows) C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\
(On Ubuntu) /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
(On Mac) /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.0/lib/python2.7/site-packages

3: Test imports:
--------------------
Start python the way you did in the Step 1 Test.
    This time, run "import Cpyx" instead.

4: Test SeedWater
--------------------
Double-click "SeedWaterSegmenter.py" and run it.
    Wait a long time.
    If it crashes, try this:
        Open "SeedWaterSegmenter.py", find the value USE_COMPILE.  Change it to False
        Try SeedWater again...
        If it still crashes, try Double-clicking CompileNTest_SeedWaterImports_pyx.py and run it.
        Then try SeedWater again...
(If it still won't run, let me know and I'll try to help!)
Hooray it works!

To get started using it, select a tiff stack in the window it opens and then hit Ctrl-G to run gaussian...
After that, move to Figure 2. This is where you can now view and edit the seed points.




BTW, if you plan on doing any significant work with python yourself, I DEFINITELY recommend getting these coding tools:

* Geany for editing and running scripts (Windows/Linux only ... on Mac, you might try Editra or SciTE or Stani's Python Editor instead)
  http://www.geany.org/

* PySlices for interactive use.  PySlices is a modified version of PyCrust that I made to support multi-line command blocks... look at these for more info:
