This is a simple source-only repository.
See the Google Code page for the binary releases (http://code.google.com/p/seedwater/) that should work on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Linux.

This requires manual compilation of the C extension with Cpyx.py (a hack-ish Cython/gcc compiler).
I realize there are better ways to do this, but this one always works.
