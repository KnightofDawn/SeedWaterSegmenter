# This is a sample matplotlib configuration file.  It should be placed
# in HOME/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc (unix/linux like systems) and
# C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\.matplotlib (win32 systems)
#
# By default, the installer will overwrite the existing file in the
# install path, so if you want to preserve your's, please move it to
# your HOME dir and set the environment variable if necessary.
#
# This file is best viewed in a editor which supports python mode
# syntax highlighting

# Blank lines, or lines starting with a comment symbol, are ignored,
# as are trailing comments.  Other lines must have the format
