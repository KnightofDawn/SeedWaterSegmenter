= SeedWater Segmenter =

Seedwater Segmenter (SWS) is a graphical Python program to interactively segment image stacks of cells in tissue with edge-labels (aka. white outlines). The interactions are entirely based on the editing of seeds, which in turn are expanded by a watershed algorithm. The major difference between SWS and other tools is that you can place more than one seed per cell which can help you adjust the boundaries of difficult cells.

SWS is built on top of wxPython, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and mahotas. It uses Cython and Cpyx for time-critical sections of code (namely updating the seed array from the seed list).

At its core, it uses a lightning-fast watershed algorithm (thanks to the mahotas project) and allows real-time updates. It has a simple (if cluttered) UI and is fully interactive, even including 1-level undo.

There is an upcoming publication about SWS that gives all these details and more in Cytometry Part A.

This requires manual compilation of the C extension with Cpyx.py (a hack-ish Cython/gcc compiler). I realize there are better ways to do this, but this one always works.

The Google Code page has binary releases (http://code.google.com/p/seedwater/) that should work on 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Linux.

== Installing and Running ==

Installing is unnecessarily complex right now (I would prefer some binaries and/or auto-compiled solution on PyPI), but the instruction in the package are not too difficult to follow:

The latest version is called:

"Python Install Instructions June 2011.txt"

https://github.com/davidmashburn/SeedWaterSegmenter/blob/master/Python%20Install%20Instructions%20June%202011.txt

*Update:* SeedWater is about to get a whole lot easier to install! There are now *no compiled modules*, so the code should just run from the source directory once all the dependencies are installed. If you want to try it, check out the 5.0 preview. This version has not been thoroughly tested and major changes were made under the hood (notable use of matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap and EXTENSIVE use of scipy.sparse to replace the compiled modules), so use with caution.
